Pro-Ject
======================

This is just the base code for Pro-ject, a Kinect Application. If you want/need the additional code and libraries please see the full library at:  https://github.com/PaigePonzeka/-Pro-ject

Users use their hands to guide blocks around the stage. One white target block taunts the user (with different words and phrases). When the white block is hit enough the level, along with the music and color theme, changes.

This was build off of existing libraries and code to create an interactive "art piece" for a motion capture class. It was a collaborative project with one other individual. I'm most proud of this project since I sort of "took the lead" on the creation and development aspects and both my partner and I worked really hard on it. We took the app to a demo show our senior year and it was pretty popular.
